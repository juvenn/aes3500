libfprint hacking guide for AES3500
===================================

[libfprint][project] is the fingerprint library for Linux, which
offers a single API for application developers to access fingerprint
devices. It includes a handful of drivers to support a wide range of
devices.

This guide with related resource is setup to help further improve the
driver for AES3500, as well as AES4000, both of which share a very
similiar interface. The documents, debugging output, as well as code
patches are collected and shared here for developers to easily pick it
up and hack on it.

### About AuthenTech AES3500 and AES4000

AES3500 is a pretty old fingerprint device produced by AuthenTech. It
possesses a press-typed sensor of dimension in 128x128. While AES4000
has a dimension in 96x96.

The first driver code has been developed by [Daniel Drake][@dsd] for
AES4000. Then the support for AES3500 is later added by tunning params
upon AES4000 driver (see `debug/UsbSnoop.log`).

At the moment, while there seems no problem scanning a fingerprint with
the driver, the verification rate is unsatifyingly low. Thus it is
considered *work in progress*. And your contributions are welcome.

Beyond libfprint, there was another (unmaintained) project
[biopod][biopod] trying to bring AES3500 to Linux. And there's a
hackish attempt to install it [in OpenWrt][h-wrt].

### What is included

    |-- debug
    |   |-- lsusb.txt    # description of usb interface
    |   |-- spiked.log   # log translated to "readable" bytes
    |   `-- UsbSnoop.log # a sniffed log of usb transfer in Windows
    |-- doc
    |   |-- aes3500-datasheet.pdf
    |   `-- aes4000-datasheet.pdf
    |-- README.md
    `-- src
	`-- aes3500.patch # code patches by `git format-patch`

The `aes3500.patch` would be empty, if the patch get merged into
libfprint.

### Getting started

You need to build and compile [libfprint][repo] from latest code, with
`aes3500.patch` applied. Then build and compile
[fprint_demo][fprint_demo], which is a GUI application to test
fingerprint capture and verify.

You may need those dependencies, on Debian-based distributions:

* build-essential
* libpam0g-dev
* libmagick++-dev
* libusb-1.0-0-dev
* libgtk2.0-dev
* libnss3-dev

Please follow these commands (# are comments):

    # install the dependencies
    $ sudo aptitude install build-essential libpam0g-dev libmagick++-dev
    $ sudo aptitude install libusb-1.0-0-dev libgtk2.0-dev libnss3-dev

    # build and compile libfprint
    $ git clone https://github.com/juvenn/aes3500.git
    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/libfprint/libfprint
    $ cd libfprint
    $ git checkout -b myhack
    # if there're patches
    $ git apply ../aes3500/src/aes3500.patch
    $ ./auotgen.sh
    $ make
    # install to /usr/local
    $ sudo make install # install to /usr/local

    # build and compile fprint_demo
    $ cd ..
    $ git clone https://github.com/dsd/fprint_demo
    $ cd fprint_demo
    $ ./autogen.sh
    # load libfprint library from /usr/local
    $ ./configure PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

Then you're ready to go:

    $ sudo fprint_demo

### Share

Please share the documents you find, the useful log you produce, and the
tools that might be helpful. Code patches should be submitted to
libfprint project directly.
